How to build and run?

1. Build WeatherPipeMapReduce
	- go to CS307Team16/WeatherPipe/src/main/dist/WeatherPipeMapReduce/
	- run “grade build”
	- go to CS307Team16/WeatherPipe/src/main/dist/WeatherPipeMapReduce/build/libs/ and you will find a file called WeatherPipeMapReduce.jar
	
2. Build WeatherPipe
	- go to CS307Team16/WeatherPipe
	- run “grade build”
	- go to CS307Team16/WeatherPipe/build/distributions and you will find a file called WeatherPipe.jar

3. Run WeatherPipe
	- copy WeatherPipeMapReduce.jar into CS307Team16/WeatherPipe/build/distributions 
		- if you are using the default setup, you can use: cp WeatherPipeMapReduce.jar ../../../../../../../WeatherPipe/build/distributions/
	- untar WeatherPipe.jar in CS307Team16/WeatherPipe/src/main/dist/WeatherPipeMapReduce/build/libs/
		- if you are using the default setup, go to CS307Team16/WeatherPipe/build/distributions you can use: tar xvf WeatherPipe.jar 

Since you are already in CS307Team16/WeatherPipe/build/distributions, you can simply run WeatherPipe from that directory.
For sample run, use: WeatherPipe/bin/WeatherPipe -s "01/01/2010 07:30:00" -e "01/01/2010 23:00:00" -st KAKQ

The output files for every run will be downloaded to CS307Team16/WeatherPipe/build/distributions.
